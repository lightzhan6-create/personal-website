## Why Choose Freecat Blog

**Your Data Stays With You**

- Your original articles stay on your computer and in your GitHub repository
- Even if a cloud deployment or platform service fails, you do not lose ownership of your writing
- You are not locked into one platform, so you can back up, move, or republish your content anytime

**Powerful Features**

- Articles can be pinned or hidden freely
- Support for custom tags
- Markdown supports math formulas, diagrams, flowcharts, sequence diagrams, Gantt charts, and more
- Supports audio and video playback
- Supports embedded external websites
- Long code blocks auto-collapse with built-in top/bottom navigation and expand/collapse controls

**Beginner-Friendly**

- No metadata needed at all—just write your content
- Customize the site's look, profile, social links, pinning, and visibility through simple fields or checkboxes in Markdown metadata and control files, without a complex dashboard or code
- Supports `.md`, `.txt`, and other formats
- No need to worry about formatting—plain text works perfectly

**Automatic Formatting**

- Automatic optimization for mixed Chinese/English text spacing
- Focus on writing content, and the system handles the rest

> **Tip:** If you run into build issues, simply go to the main repository, copy the latest [sync-upstream](https://github.com/OUBIGFA/Freecat-Blog/blob/main/.github/workflows/sync-upstream.yml) or [update-git-dates.yml](https://github.com/OUBIGFA/FreeBlog_BIGFA/blob/main/.github/workflows/update-git-dates.yml) workflow file to your repo, and run it manually. It only syncs build files and will not overwrite your custom settings or writing/ folder. To use new features, copy the relevant settings from the main repository's [Control folder](https://github.com/OUBIGFA/Freecat-Blog/tree/main/Control) into your own `Control/` folder.

## Shortest Deployment Path

1. Create your own private blog repository with GitHub Importer
2. Import the repository into Cloudflare Pages or Vercel and build
3. Wait for the build to finish, then open the default URL to verify

---

## Shortest Usage Path

1. Clone the repository to your computer with GitHub Desktop
2. Open the project locally and write or drop an article into the `writing` folder
3. Commit and push to GitHub via GitHub Desktop
4. Wait for the platform to build and deploy automatically
5. Done

---

## Just Three Things

- Your content stays local. It is not locked into any platform.
- GitHub handles backup and notifies the deployment platform.
- The deployment platform only generates the website. It is not your writing backend.

## 1. What Is Freecat Blog

Freecat Blog is a personal blog template that turns local Markdown articles into a website automatically.

How it works:

```text
Your computer: write in writing/ and edit site settings in Control/
        ↓
GitHub Desktop syncs changes to GitHub
        ↓
Cloudflare Pages / Vercel builds automatically
        ↓
Your blog website updates automatically
```

Your articles and settings are stored on both your computer and GitHub. Cloudflare Pages / Vercel only generates and publishes the web pages, so your content does not disappear if you switch platforms later.

![01](all/image/Tutorial/00a.png)
![02](all/image/Tutorial/00b.png)
![03](all/image/Tutorial/00c.png)
![04](all/image/Tutorial/00d.png)

Good for people who:

- Want a personal blog without buying a server or maintaining a backend
- Want to write with Markdown, Obsidian, VS Code, or another editor
- Want to keep article files under their own control
- Want free deployment and the option to switch platforms later

What you get:

- Auto-generated home page, article pages, archive, search, and About page
- Article fields for tags, cover image, summary, pinning, and visibility
- Automatic formatting for mixed Chinese/English text, number-unit spacing, code blocks, and math
- Built-in SEO and AI discovery support, including Sitemap, RSS, llms.txt, and a simple Google/Bing submission guide. See `Control/SEO_搜索优化.md` for details
- Audio player generation from direct audio links in articles
- Site name, avatar, social links, and theme customization without writing code

- Less is more — no unnecessary animations or visual noise, just a clean, undisturbed reading experience where readability comes first

## 2. The Three Folders You Need to Know

| Folder | Edit often? | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `writing/` | Yes | Blog articles. One Markdown file is one article |
| `Control/` | Yes | Site name, avatar, home intro, social links, About page |
| `all/` | No | Deployment platforms build the website from here |

Remember this:

**Write articles in** `writing/`, edit site information in `Control/`, and set the deployment root directory to `all`.

---

## 3. Preparation

| Tool / Account | Required? | Purpose | Link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub account | Required | Stores your blog repository | <https://github.com/signup> |
| GitHub Desktop | Required | Syncs local changes to GitHub | <https://desktop.github.com/download> |
| Markdown editor | Required | Writes articles and edits settings; Obsidian is recommended | <https://obsidian.md/> |
| Cloudflare account | Recommended | Free blog deployment | <https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up> |
| Vercel account | Optional | Another free deployment option | <https://vercel.com/signup> |

Choose either Cloudflare Pages or Vercel. Complete beginners should start with Cloudflare Pages.

---

## 4. Quick Deployment

Deployment has two steps:

1. Copy Freecat Blog into your own GitHub repository.
2. Connect that repository to Cloudflare Pages or Vercel.

### Step 1: Create Your Own GitHub Repository

1. Sign in to GitHub.
2. Open <https://github.com/new/import>.
3. Fill in the form:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `Your old repository's clone URL` | `https://github.com/OUBIGFA/Freecat-Blog` |
| `Owner` | Your GitHub account |
| `Repository name` | Choose a name, such as `my-freecat-blog` |
| `Privacy` | Use `Private` |

1. Click `Begin import` and wait for it to finish.
2. Open GitHub Desktop and click `File` -> `Clone repository`.
3. Select the imported repository and clone it to your computer.

![GitHub Desktop clone](all/image/Tutorial/10.png)

After importing, your computer has a complete Freecat Blog project folder.

### Step 2: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

Cloudflare Pages is the recommended option. The key is filling in the build settings correctly.

1. Sign in to the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Create an application.

![Cloudflare step 1](all/image/Tutorial/01.png)

1. Select Pages.

![Cloudflare step 2](all/image/Tutorial/02.png)

1. Choose "Import an existing Git repository".

![Cloudflare step 3](all/image/Tutorial/03.png)

1. Select your blog repository.

![Cloudflare step 4](all/image/Tutorial/04.png)

1. Fill in the build settings:

| Cloudflare English UI | Cloudflare Chinese UI | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Framework preset | 框架预设 | `None` / leave unset |
| Root directory (advanced) > Path | 根目录（高级） | `all` |
| Build command | 构建命令 | `npm run build` |
| Build output directory | 构建输出目录 | `dist` |
| Environment variables | 环境变量 | `NODE_VERSION` = `20` |

![Cloudflare step 5](all/image/Tutorial/05.png)

> The most common mistake: set output directory to `dist`, not `all/dist`, because the root directory is already `all`.

1. Click `Save and Deploy` and wait 1-3 minutes.

> In the Cloudflare Pages project settings, enable `Build cache`. The font subsetting toolchain is now pure npm dependencies, so installs finish in seconds once the dependency cache warms up; builds reuse the subsets committed in the repository when they cover the known article text, and expanding them after articles add new characters only takes seconds — no Python environment required.

2. When the build finishes, open the default URL from Cloudflare, such as `xxx.pages.dev`.

![Cloudflare step 6](all/image/Tutorial/06.png)

To use your own domain, bind a custom domain in the Cloudflare Pages project.

- DNSHE auto-renew project: <https://github.com/OUBIGFA/dnshe-auto-renew>

### Alternative: Deploy to Vercel

If you already use Vercel, you can choose it directly.

1. Sign in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
2. Click `Add New...` -> `Project`.
3. Connect GitHub and choose your blog repository.
4. On the import page, find `Root Directory` and click `Edit`.

![Vercel root directory edit](all/image/Tutorial/11.png)

5. In the dialog, select the `all` folder and click `Continue`.

![Vercel root directory select all](all/image/Tutorial/12.png)

6. Keep every other setting at its default and click `Deploy`.

Root Directory is the only setting you need to change on Vercel. The build command, output directory, and URL rules are handled automatically by `all/vercel.json` in the repository, so do not expand `Build and Output Settings` to override them.

> The most common mistake: not selecting `all` as the Root Directory, or manually overriding the build settings. Either one prevents Vercel from reading `all/vercel.json`, and every page of the deployed site returns 404.

Vercel restores its build cache automatically. Freecat Blog reuses the font subset cache from it; when your articles do not introduce new characters, later deployments skip font generation, and characters generated for deleted articles stay in the subset for future reuse. Do not clear the Build Cache in project settings unless you intentionally want to force regeneration.

To bind a custom domain, open project settings -> `Domains` and follow the DNS instructions.

## 5. Write Articles and Customize the Site

### Write Articles: Use `writing/`

`writing/` is the folder you will use most. Each `.md` file is one article.

The project includes sample articles. You can open them to learn the format, copy one as a template, or delete them.

A new article usually starts like this:

```md
---
title: My First Article
date: 2026-01-01
tag:
  - notes
cover:
show_image_captions: true
description:
pinned: false
show: true
---

Article content starts here.
```

Common fields:

| Field | Purpose | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | Article title; filename is used if empty | `My First Article` |
| `date` | Publish date | `2026-01-01` |
| `tag` | Article tags; multiple allowed | `- notes` |
| `cover` | Cover image URL; empty means no cover | `https://...` |
| `show_image_captions` | Show image captions | `true` / `false` |
| `description` | Article summary; empty means auto excerpt | `A short intro` |
| `pinned` | Pin to top | `true` / `false` |
| `show` | Show on the website | `true` / `false` |

### Customize the Site: Use `Control/`

`Control/` is the site control panel. Edit it to turn the template into your own blog.

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `site_网站属性.md` | Site title, site name, home intro, avatar, theme |
| `SEO_搜索优化.md` | Canonical domain, SEO summary, author info, AI crawlers, llms.txt |
| `social_社交媒体.md` | Social icons, profile links, contact methods, promo links |
| `about_关于页面.md` | About page title, intro, and avatar |

Editing rules:

- Keep one space after the colon, such as `site_name: FreeCat`
- Leave unused fields empty, but do not delete the whole line
- Lines starting with `_01`, `_02`, etc. are descriptions; do not rename them
- Commit and push with GitHub Desktop after editing, otherwise the live site will not update

---

## 6. Daily Update Workflow

After deployment, every article or site update follows these 5 steps:

1. Add or edit articles in `writing/`.
2. Edit site settings in `Control/` if needed.
3. Save the files.
4. Open GitHub Desktop, write a short commit message, and click `Commit to main`.
5. Click `Push origin`.

![GitHub Desktop commit](all/image/Tutorial/08.png)

![GitHub Desktop push](all/image/Tutorial/09.png)

After syncing, Cloudflare Pages or Vercel rebuilds automatically. Refresh the site after 1-3 minutes to see the new content.

---

### Embed Audio and Video Players in Articles

You can place audio players and video players directly inside articles. The important point is simple: the link must be a direct file link, not a normal cloud-drive sharing page.

A normal sharing link usually opens a cloud-drive page first, then asks the reader to click download or play. The blog cannot turn that kind of page into a player.

A direct file link usually opens or downloads the audio or video file immediately when pasted into the browser address bar. That is the kind of link the blog needs.

#### Audio Player

Use blockquote syntax with a direct audio link:

```
![I Still Believe](https://xxxx.mp3)
```

If the link has no obvious audio extension, add the music symbol in the title:

```
![🎵I Still Believe](https://xxxx)
```

Supported formats: `.mp3`, `.m4a`, `.wav`, `.ogg`, `.aac`, `.flac`, `.opus`.

#### Video Player

Use image syntax with a direct video link:

```
![Demo video](https://example.com/video.mp4)
```

If the link has no obvious video extension, add the movie symbol in the title:

```
![🎬Demo video](https://example.com/video)
```

Supported formats: `.mp4`, `.webm`, `.mov`, `.m4v`, `.ogv`, `.m3u8`.

#### Convert Cloud-Drive Sharing Links to Direct Links

The recommended workflow is to upload your audio or video to a cloud drive, then use a direct-link tool to convert the sharing link into a direct file link that can be used in an article.

Recommended tools:

- [Cloud-drive direct link tool](https://link.gimhoy.com/)
- [Cloud-drive sharing link to direct link tool](https://lz.qaiu.top/)
- [Feijipan cloud drive](https://www.feijipan.com)

The simple workflow:

1. Upload the audio or video file to a cloud drive.
2. Create a sharing link in the cloud drive and copy it.
3. Open one of the direct-link tools above and paste the sharing link.
4. Click parse, convert, or get direct link.
5. Copy the new link generated by the tool.
6. Put the new link into the audio or video example format in your article.

If the tool gives you an audio direct link, write it like this:

```
>[🎵I Still Believe](https://direct-audio-link-from-the-tool)
```

If the tool gives you a video direct link, write it like this:

```
![🎬Is Chinese food healthy?](https://direct-video-link-from-the-tool)
```

To check whether a link can be used, paste it into the browser address bar. If the browser plays the file, downloads the file, or shows only the file itself, it usually works. If it opens a cloud-drive page, login page, extraction-code page, or ad page, it usually cannot be used directly and needs to be converted again.

Note: cloud-drive direct links may expire. If a player in an article suddenly stops working, first check whether the original shared file still exists, then generate a fresh direct link with the tool.

## 7. Advanced Features

### Writing with Obsidian

You can open this blog repository directly in Obsidian and write articles in `writing/`.

Benefits:

- Articles stay local and easy to manage
- You can use Obsidian backlinks, tags, and search
- After writing, sync with GitHub Desktop and the site publishes automatically

### Local Preview and Build

If you only write articles and deploy, you do not need to build locally. The deployment platform handles it.

To preview on your computer, install [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/) first, then run:

```bash
cd all
npm install
npm run preview
```

This command runs a full build first, then starts the local preview at the fixed URL: `http://127.0.0.1:4173/`.
The output is in `all/dist/`. Do not edit it manually and do not commit it to GitHub.

## 8. Template Update Sync

Freecat Blog may continue to receive bug fixes, features, and style improvements. The repository includes this GitHub Actions workflow:

`.github/workflows/sync-upstream.yml`

Every Tuesday at 02:17 Beijing time, it syncs template files from [OUBIGFA/Freecat-Blog](https://github.com/OUBIGFA/Freecat-Blog) and commits them to your `main` branch. Cloudflare Pages / Vercel rebuilds automatically after that commit.

Important: whether you created your repository with GitHub Importer or by forking this project, GitHub may not run repository Actions by default. Before relying on automatic template sync, open the `Actions` tab in your own repository and enable workflows if GitHub asks. The repository Actions permission must also allow write access, otherwise the sync can fetch upstream changes but cannot commit them back to your `main` branch.

Sync scope:

- Synced: `all/`, `README.md`, `README.en.md`
- Preserved: `all/git-dates.json`, `all/build/font-subsets-manifest.json`, `all/src/assets/fonts/`
- Not touched: `Control/`, `writing/`, `.github/`, `.gitignore`

Your own articles and site settings will not be overwritten by template updates.

To run the sync immediately:

1. Open your GitHub repository.
2. Click `Actions`.
3. Select `Sync upstream template files`.
4. Click `Run workflow` -> `Run workflow`.

Notes:

- If upstream template files have not changed, the workflow skips the commit.
- If the `Actions` page says workflows are disabled, or this is the first time you open `Actions` after importing/forking, enable them first. After enabling, you can click `Run workflow` once to test it.
- If you edited templates, styles, or build scripts in `all/`, automatic sync may overwrite those edits. Beginners usually do not need to edit `all/`.

---

## 9. FAQ

**Q: Do I need to know how to code?**

No. Day to day, you only write Markdown articles and edit config files.

**Q: Where should I usually edit?**

Articles go in `writing/`. Site settings go in `Control/`. Beginners usually should not edit `all/`.

**Q: What is `.gitignore`, and how do I use it?**

`.gitignore` is a list of files that should not be synced to GitHub. Put temporary files, drafts, and files generated by your computer in it, and GitHub Desktop will ignore them so they do not get committed by accident.

Common examples:

```gitignore
# Ignore a local drafts folder
drafts/

# Ignore files generated by the operating system
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Ignore temporary logs
*.log
```

If you simply do not want to upload a new file, open `.gitignore` in the repository root, add one line using the examples above, save it, then check GitHub Desktop again. Note: `.gitignore` only ignores new files that have not been committed yet. It does not hide files that are already in the repository.

**Q: Do I have to buy a domain?**

No. Cloudflare Pages and Vercel both provide a default URL first.

**Q: Cloudflare Pages or Vercel, which should I choose?**

Complete beginners should choose Cloudflare Pages. If you already use Vercel, Vercel is fine. Your content is on GitHub, so you can migrate later.

**Q: What is the easiest setting to get wrong during deployment?**

`Root Directory` must be `all`, and `Output Directory` must be `dist`. Do not write `all/dist`.

**Q: I changed files locally, but the site did not update. What should I check?**

Check in order: files are saved -> GitHub Desktop has pushed -> Cloudflare Pages / Vercel started a new build -> browser may need a force refresh.

**Q: Can I delete the sample articles?**

Yes. Sample articles are in `writing/`. Delete them, then commit and push.
